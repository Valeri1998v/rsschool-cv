## **About Myself:**

Just a year ago, I clearly saw how fast technologies are developing and how much they help in business processes. 
I was very interested in this. 


And today I see only one future for myself, where I will become a frontend developer,
as this gives huge opportunities for professional growth. 


In addition, there are many resources that allow you to do this. I know that my colossal
zeal, hard work, and discipline will help me achieve my goal.
